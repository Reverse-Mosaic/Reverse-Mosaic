The ```FileTypeTool``` is a component of the Reverse Mosaic multi-agent binary analysis toolkit. It serves to determine the file type of binary files. This tool utilizes the magic library in Python to analyze the content of binary files and identify their types.

By providing the path to a binary file, users can quickly retrieve information about its file type. The tool returns a string indicating the detected file type, such as ```application/pdf```, ```text/plain```, ```image/jpeg```, etc.

The ```FileTypeTool``` is easy to use, with a simple method call to obtain file type information. Additionally, it's extensible, making it possible to integrate into various binary analysis workflows.

This tool contributes to the arsenal of utilities available for analyzing binary files, enhancing the capabilities of researchers, security professionals, and developers in understanding and processing binary data.
