The ```StringsTool``` is an essential component of the Reverse Mosaic multi-agent binary analysis toolkit. It provides functionality for extracting strings from binary files, aiding in the identification of human-readable text within binaries.

The ```get_strings``` method extracts strings from a binary file, identifying sequences of characters that appear to be text. These strings may include function names, variable names, error messages, and other human-readable content embedded within the binary.
